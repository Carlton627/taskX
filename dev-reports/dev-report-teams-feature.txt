Component: Create Team Form
Status: Blocked

    ðŸ‘‰ The development of the form component to add teams has been blocked, as cloud firestore 
        does not support searching of collections out of the box.

    ðŸ‘‰ Algolia Search API must be used to create indexes of the collections that have to be searched.

    ðŸ‘‰ To use the API, the firebase project requires to be upgraded to the Blaze Plan to gain access to
        cloud functions.

    ðŸ‘‰ The DEV work can resume once the firebase project billing plan has been upgraded to the Blaze plan.

    In order for the users to be added to a team, the team creator needs to have the ability to search users using
    the app (more specific params can be decided later).


Component: Notification System 
Status: Blocked

    ðŸ‘‰ The Notification Systems tentative architecture may rely heavily on Cloud Functions, which requires 
        the project to be upgraded.

    ðŸ‘‰ A front end behavior of notifications have been developed, except for accepting a team invite which can be
        tested end to end only after the create team form component has been developed.

    This notification system will help the users have a right to choose whether to join a team, and also help them
    know what is happening on the app (like nearing deadlines, etc).


Component: Team Page
Status: Blocked

    ðŸ‘‰ The front end behaviour of the Teams Page has been developed. Further testing can only be done once the user
        has the ability to create teams.

    ðŸ‘‰ Upon clicking on one of the team card, the app should redirect the user to the dashboard of the team.
